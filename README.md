## My javascript solutions on some of the various DSA problems

### String/Numbers

- [isAnagram - Time: O(n), Space: O(n) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/anagram.js)
  > find if two given strings are anagrams
- [isSameDigitFrequency - Time: O(n), Space: O(n) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/isSameDigitFrequency.js)
  > Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

### Arrays

- [removeDuplicates - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/removeDuplicates.js)
  > Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
- [removeDuplicates2 - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/removeDuplicates2.js)
  > Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
