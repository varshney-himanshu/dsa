## My javascript solutions on some of the various DSA problems

### String/Numbers

- [isAnagram - Frequency Counter Time: O(n), Space: O(n) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/anagram.js)
  > find if two given strings are anagrams
- [isSameDigitFrequency - Frequency Counter - Time: O(n), Space: O(n) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/isSameDigitFrequency.js)
  > Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

### Arrays

- [removeDuplicates - Two pointer - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/removeDuplicates.js)
  > Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
- [removeDuplicates2 - Two pointer - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/removeDuplicates2.js)
  > Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
- [minimumAverageDifference - Sliding Window - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) ](https://github.com/varshney-himanshu/dsa/blob/main/javascript/minimumAverageDifference.js)
  > You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n. The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer. Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.
